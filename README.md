# C Language Learning ðŸš€

This repository documents my journey of learning "C programming from scratch".  
Every program, from basics â†’ loops â†’ arrays â†’ pointers â†’ projects, will be uploaded here.

### Goals:
* Write 100+ C programs by December 2025.
* Complete at least 1 major C project (Railway Booking System).

### Structure:
 1) basics â†’ Hello world, variables, loops, functions
 2) practice â†’ Daily problem-solving
 3) projects â†’ Mini & major projects

ðŸ’¡ This repo will be my foundation before moving to Java, Python, and full-stack development.
